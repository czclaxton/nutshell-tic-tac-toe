#### **1. What's your proudest achievement? It can be from work, a side project, or something unrelated to tech. We're interested in knowing about what you think is noteworthy and motivating.**

<br>
My proudest achievement is my work ethic. I pride myself in showing up on time, working hard, and always being open to learning new skills. I use exercises like this tic-tac-toe project to challenge myself with implementing a new technology or to improve in a particular area. In this case, I learned about optimizing my React code by utilizing the tools that React provides for things such as memoization or reducing re-renders with useCallback.

#### **2. Tell us about an interesting work-related book, article, or presentation that you saw recently. Tell us why, give us a recommendation, and sell us on it!**

<br>
I recently watched a presentation given by Philip Roberts at JSConf EU. He gave an engaging talk on the event loop and how it works. He took something complex and explained it in very simple terms. When working with JavaScript I think it's important to have a better understanding of terms that we hear all the time like non-blocking, callback, async, etc.

#### **3. From what you’ve seen on our web site, write about who Nutshell’s customers are, and what problems they’re looking to solve.**

<br>
Nutshell caters towards any business or entity that is looking to improve and grow. These customers are looking to identify their problems, optimize work-flows, automate redundant tasks, and improve visibility with customer needs without adding unnecessary complexity.

#### **4. Describe something that you do outside of work that's least similar to what you do at work.**

<br>
I am big fan of the sport of basketball so I spend a lot of my free time playing, watching the NBA, and keeping up on everything with things like podcasts or youtube.
<br>
<br>

#### **5. Describe something you do at work that's furthest from your official description.**

<br>
I worked on creating and maintaining documentation for a legacy Java/Groovy api. I was hired on to seamlessly migrate the service over to Node. While figuring out how the api worked (there was no existing documentation), I created thorough documentation using Open API Specification 3.0. With any subsequent updates to any endpoints or related parts, I made sure the documentation stayed in sync.

#### **6. Tell us about the last time you had to reconsider a closely-held opinion. What caused your change in thinking?**

<br>
I used to prefer OOP as a paradigm due to the logical organization of data into entities because it was familiar and made sense to me in the most obvious of ways. After working with some experienced developers that strongly preferred a functional paradigm, i've changed my opinion to preferring FP because of the simplicity that it brings as the code scales due to the modularity of it as well as the ease of testing.
